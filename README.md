## DB2 ON NODE.JS ##

- This is a project that one can use to bring up a db2 instance (docker + db2-expressC) and be able to connect/ run queries through a REST API.
- Eventually everything will be automated, so in a matter of minutes some can have a "blank/template" node server and an ibm db2 database up.
- Some functionality out of the box includes: 
  1. a sample db with 1 table (Users).
  2. connecting and adding, removing and modifying that table.
  
This can be great for a quick websie that need to manage users with no authentification (for now).
